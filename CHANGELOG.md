# Changelog

Notable changes to the public API (`miniworld_engine.kernels`) are recorded
here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

The public surface is enforced by `tests/test_public_api.py`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`miniworld-engine audit`** — verifies the build system and, new, that every
  DECLARED `(op, dtype, shape-bucket)` is present in the shipped autotune cache.
  Declared means `registry.csv` crossed with each kernel's `level` and `dtypes`,
  so a hole is reported against the contract rather than against whatever the
  last build happened to measure. `build` already told users to run this; the
  subcommand did not exist and `build/audit.py` crashed on import.
- **`settings.autotune_miss_cap`** (default 24) — how many configs an autotune
  cache MISS may search before falling back to a heuristic subset.
- **`miniworld_engine.ops` — the whole-op consumer contract.** Complete,
  autograd-transparent model-layer ops (weights as arguments, backend dispatch +
  fwd/bwd inside), consumed as a single call: `triangle_multiplicative_update`,
  `triangle_attention`, `transition`, `conditioned_transition`,
  `augmented_attention_pair_bias`, `layer_norm_linear`, `layer_norm`. Lazy,
  side-effect-free import; pinned by `_OPS_CONTRACT` in `tests/test_public_api.py`.
  Verified fwd+bwd vs the pytorch/cuequiv reference on B200 (≥0.9998).
- Public API contract test (`tests/test_public_api.py`): freezes the
  `kernels` surface and asserts the package import is side-effect-free.
- Numerical correctness suite (`tests/test_numerical.py`): each op's fused
  MINIWORLD backend vs the PyTorch reference (forward + input gradient),
  GPU-gated, asserting the fused path is actually engaged (no silent
  dtype-degrade). Promotes the benchmark cosine checks into an enforced
  correctness gate.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): ruff + ty + the whole CPU suite on every
  push/PR (nested cutlass submodule skipped; CPU torch wheel installed so the
  type gate can see the stubs it is checking against). `ty`, not pyright, which
  cannot parse jaxtyping shape strings; the step gates, with no `|| true`. GPU
  numerical suite runs via `pixi run test-gpu` on an allocated node.

### Changed
- **An autotune cache miss no longer sweeps the full grid.** Triton kernels now
  narrow a miss to `autotune_miss_cap` configs centred on `num_warps` in {4, 8}
  and `num_stages` in {2, 3, 4}; the shipped grid is 205,266 configs, so the old
  behaviour put a tuning sweep inside the first production forward on any GPU
  without a cache. A build (`run_autotune=True`) still gets the whole space.
  The warning text now names the fallback that actually happened instead of
  always claiming "the full autotune grid".
- **Autotune cache entries are keyed on the toolchain and the kernel source**,
  not only on the config grid: new `env_identity` (triton/torch/CUDA/ptxas) and
  `op_identity` (kernel source + `key=[...]`) fields. Entries written before
  these existed still read, so committed caches do not become permanent misses.
- **API framing**: `ops` is now the supported **consumer** surface; `kernels` is
  reframed as the **internal primitive** surface (per-GEMM/LN/gate/attention units)
  out of which the ops are built — still pinned (`_CONTRACT`) for internal stability
  but not intended for model code. `triangle_multiplicative_update` moved from
  `kernels` to `ops` accordingly.
- **Packaging**: runtime `[project.dependencies]` slimmed to the kernel core
  (`torch`, `triton`, `einops`, `jaxtyping`, `numpy`). Benchmark harness,
  comparison baselines, the CuTeDSL backend, and dev tooling moved to
  `[project.optional-dependencies]` extras (`bench`, `baselines`, `cute`,
  `dev`). Installing the package for `miniworld_engine.kernels` no longer pulls
  lightning / hydra / cuequivariance / scipy / cutlass.

- Moved 21 unreferenced dev/probe/experiment kernel files (perf probes,
  autotune/tile sweeps, micro-benchmarks, superseded variants) out of the
  importable `src/` package into `research/` (convention: `src/` ships only
  the canonical path). Verified 0 importers + contract & numerical suites green.

### Fixed
- **`kernels.cuda_transition` has never worked and now says so.** Its body
  deferred to `transition.cuda.cuda_transition`, a symbol with no history in
  this repo; the module binds only `cuda_transition_b2b` and
  `cuda_transition_expand_gate`. `Transition(implementation="cuda")` resolves to
  `KernelBackend.CUDA` and calls it in `forward`, so that path raised
  `ImportError` from four frames down. It now raises `NotImplementedError`
  naming what does exist. The name stays (the surface is frozen) but the
  CUDA backend for `Transition` should be considered unavailable.
- **`miniworld-engine build all` works as documented.** Its config-set argument
  defaulted to the string `"default"` and `configs/default` has never existed,
  so the command failed at argument parsing; `bench_module` hardcoded the same
  string. Both now default to the full search grid.
- **The per-op sweep never merged its shards.** `build all` ran to completion,
  wrote its shards, and left `data/` untouched — the build reported success and
  shipped nothing. It also refused to merge at all if any single unit failed,
  discarding every good measurement in the run.
- **`build all` never drove fp32.** The work list ignored `registry.csv`'s
  `dtypes` column and emitted bfloat16 for every unit, so the fp32 half of 66
  kernels was never tuned — and the coverage check counted `(op, bucket)` with
  no dtype axis, so it reported full coverage over a half-built cache.
- **`level=both` kernels built pair activations at atom shapes.** 18 kernels
  asked for `M = L*L` where production hands `M = A` — 67,108,864 rows at
  L=8192 — which is the whole explanation for the sweep's CUDA OOMs and one
  int32 offset overflow, and it poisoned those kernels' atom-bucket entries.
- **Shard writes are atomic.** A bare `write_text` let two workers interleave on
  one shard and produce unparseable JSON, which the merge then dropped silently,
  losing a whole unit's measurements with nothing said.
- Repo-wide int64 promotion of Triton `program_id` / loop-index pointer offsets
  (raw-indexing kernels), fixing an illegal-memory-access at large `L`
  (`augmented_attention` atom training, L≥768). `make_block_ptr` kernels keep
  int32 block offsets (Triton constraint); CUTE int32 (tmem addr, RNG seed)
  left as-is.

## [0.1.0]
- Initial consolidation of AF3-style op kernels (triangle multiplication,
  transition, triangle/bias/augmented attention, layernorm, adaLN) with
  Triton / CuTeDSL / CUDA backends.
